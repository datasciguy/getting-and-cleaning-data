Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

Acquire data for the assignment here:

Objectives
Write a script called run_analysis.R which satsifies 5 requirements:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Per the assignment instructions:
The code should run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory.

My version of run_analysis.R contains a combination of verbose comments and sceen output
in order to facilitate the initial analysis.  Comments contain functional statements
to explain commands in the script, and also thought-process statements to
explain the analysis process that was followed during script development.  The
screen output is paired with the script comments and designed to verify each step of 
the analysis along the way.

Read CodeBook.md and the run_analysis.R for further details.
