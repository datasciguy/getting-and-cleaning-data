just notes right now, will actually write this soon...

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

 a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?

You should include a README.md in the repo describing how the script works and the code book describing the variables.


Either a wide or a long form of the data is acceptable if it meets the tidy data principles of week 1 (Each variable you measure should be in one column, Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row).


The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory
